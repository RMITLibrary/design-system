<h1 class="margin-top-zero">Icons</h1>
<p class="lead">Icons are used sparingly in the design system. Where icons are used, they should be designed to fit into one of two sizes, small (2rem square), large (6rem square).</p>
<p>Look to minimise the amount of colour used in icon designs, using <code>$rmit-blue</code> as a base colour. <code>$rmit-red</code> can be used either to indicate a clickable icon or as a minimal accent colour.</p>
<h2>Large</h2>
<p>Currently, large size icons are used in certain variations of blockquotes. They are designed on a 6rem (96px) square. Look to leave padding of 1.5rem (12px) around the icon content.</p>

<h2>Small</h2>
<p>Small icons are used in accordions, some button styles and some link styles. They are designed on a 2rem (32px square). Look to leave padding of between 0.5rem and 1rem, depending on the context. Having this extra padding ensures there is an adequate hit area for clickable elements.</p>
