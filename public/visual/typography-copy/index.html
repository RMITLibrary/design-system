<p>How do I structure an essay? Essays have three parts: A beginning... A middle... and an end. That is, the introduction, body, and conclusion. Itâ€™s important to have structure in your essay, or you will lose the flow of your argument.</p>
<p>How do I write an essay introduction? Writing an essay introduction can sometimes be quite challenging. It helps to break down your introduction into three important parts: First, start by introducing your topic. Then, state your argument. And finally, outline your main points.</p>
<p>By doing this, your introduction should start broad and become more specific, focusing in on your essay topic. Basically, youâ€™re letting the reader know what youâ€™re going to discuss throughout the essay. Letâ€™s have a look at this introduction as an example:</p>
<p>Self-confidence means possessing a positive, yet realistic, view of oneâ€™s self and abilities. Self-confident people have trust and faith in their abilities. Self-confidence can be affected by a variety of factors. This essay will argue that self-confidence develops through a complex interaction between a range of factors. The essay will firstly define self-confidence, and then analyse the interaction between various factors that affect the confidence of an individual. In particular, these are personality style, situational factors/life experiences self-efficacy and self-esteem.</p>
<p>Notice the structure: The topic and context at the start of the paragraph; the argument in the middle, and what will be covered in the essay at the end of the paragraph.</p>
<p>How do I write an essay body? An essay body is a series of paragraphs that support the main argument.</p>
<p>How do I write an essay conclusion? Your essay conclusion is written in the opposite way to the introduction: it starts narrow and becomes broad. Begin with the detail of the essay, and expand out to the bigger picture. Hereâ€™s an example of how to structure a conclusion:</p>
<p>Self-confidence is not ingrained within individuals and can be influenced by a variety of factors. The personality style of an individual can determine whether the individual is an introvert or an extrovert, which will affect self-confidence. Life experiences and situational factors have a large impact on the stability of personalities and confidence. Self-efficacy and self-esteem are major factors that can contribute to a lack of self-confidence. Self-confidence is essential for effective and positive engagement in all professional and personal activities.</p>
