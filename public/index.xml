      <description>grdgrdt dg drg drgdr&#xA;Transcript How do I structure an essay? Essays have three parts: A beginning... A middle... and an end. That is, the introduction, body, and conclusion. It’s important to have structure in your essay, or you will lose the flow of your argument.&#xA;How do I write an essay introduction? Writing an essay introduction can sometimes be quite challenging. It helps to break down your introduction into three important parts: First, start by introducing your topic.</description>

      <description>Accordions Accordions can be a useful tool in dividing and segmenting information, if used judiciously. The design system features three variants, the transcript variant is used to provide accessible content for videos and images, the navigation option (featured on the right) allows for collapsible navigation.&#xA;Default Each accordion item is controlled by the user, they decide when each item opens and closes. While there is facility to have an accordion item open by default (see bootstrap docs), this begs the question, &#34;</description>

      <description>Home Section Subsection Content page Anatomy of a page Lead paragraph (p class=”lead”). This page aims to show the basic building blocks of a page build using the Dewey design system. While different layouts will vary from this formula, this structure should be used as a starting point and altered to suit a website’s specific purpose. This example shows both page content here on the left and a right hand navigation.</description>

      <description>Blockquotes Blockquotes can be useful to highlight sections of text and can also function as a navigation device. Visually, they are obviously separate from the rest of the content and can provide prominent for the information contained within.&#xA;Basic The basic blockquote just contains text. The suggested content limit is 450 characters or 80 words.&#xA;By default, each blockquote has a margin of space-small applied top and bottom. The first element inside the blockquote has no margin top applied to it.</description>

      <description>Breakpoints and columns Breakpoints The Dewey design system is built using the Bootstrap 5 framework. As such, the system employs the following default bootstrap breakpoints.&#xA;Breakpoint Class infix Dimensions X-Small None &amp;lt;576px Small sm ≥576px Medium md ≥768px Large lg ≥992px Extra large xl ≥1200px Extra extra large xxl ≥1400px For screens &amp;lt;768px width (i.e. Small and X-small breakpoints), both the typography and spacing systems use smaller sizes.

      <description>Buttons Two different varieties of button are available in the design system. Default state The button state hews closely to Bootstrap&#39;s btn-outline-secondary style. When multiple buttons are used on a page, almost all of them should in this style.&#xA;Default button &amp;lt;button class=&amp;quot;btn btn-default&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Button label&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt; or simply &amp;lt;button&amp;gt;Button label&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt; Primary button This style should be used sparingly, ideally only one occurrence on each page. It should action something important, like submitting a form.</description>

      <description>Colour The Dewey design system uses colour sparingly. As the site aims to meet a WCAG 2.0 Triple A standard, colour contrast is paramount. However, this can limit options to provide contrast between colours, for example between text and links. Choices are made in typography to help mitigate these issues.&#xA;Primary text Dark Grey #333333&#xA;Primary colour for all text. RMIT Blue #000054&#xA;Used for links and titles Blue 70 #4D4D88</description>

      <description>Home Referencing Quoting When you are researching a topic, sometimes you want to include the exact words of another author or speaker in your own work. Using someone’s words in their original form is called quoting, or including a direct quote.&#xA;When to quote Quoting is the way to include the exact words of others in our own work. You might want to use a quote when the specific words that an author or speaker has used are important, such as when someone offers a new definition for a term or presents a new theory.</description>

      <description>Icons Icons are used sparingly in the design system. Where icons are used, they should be designed to fit into one of two sizes, small (2rem square), large (6rem square).&#xA;Look to minimise the amount of colour used in icon designs, using $rmit-blue as a base colour. $rmit-red can be used either to indicate a clickable icon or as a minimal accent colour.&#xA;Large Currently, large size icons are used in certain variations of blockquotes.</description>

      <description>Links Links occurring within paragraph text are displayed in RMIT Blue with an underline. The extra visibility the underline provides is important due the lack of contrast between RMIT Blue and the main text colour, Dark Grey. On hover, the colour changes to Blue Hover and the underline is removed. In other situations, no underline is displayed for links. In these situations, such as in navigation, the intent that the text acts as a link is clear and the repetition of the underlines would appear aesthetically unappealing and visually &#34;</description>

      <description>Navigation There are several recommended approaches to providing navigation. Using breadcrumbs at the top of the page is a simple and compact way of showing the user the website hierarchy. The right nav offers several options for providing more detailed navigation and could be useful for larger, more complex sites.&#xA;Breadcrumbs Breadcrumbs are usually placed at the top of the page, close to the page title, to help navigate sites with multiple content levels.</description>

      <description>Spacing Dewey aims to create a generic spacing system, in an attempt to maintain consistency across different components. Hopefully, the system will also allow for flexibility in the future.&#xA;Base units Default unit (1rem = 16px)&#xA;A series of units created to space elements in the page content. This system allows for responsiveness, having different values for smaller and larger screen widths.&#xA;Name Small (width &amp;lt; 768px) Medium, large etc. (width ≥ 768px) space-xs 1rem (16px) 1rem (16px) space-sm 1rem (16px) 1.</description>

      <description>Tables Tables allow data to be displayed with a structure. Be sure that the information being presented warrants being displayed in a table. Often, regular paragraphs of text are better way to communicate.&#xA;Default By default, tables feature a simple one pixel border. Each table is wrapped in a div, responsive-table, which allows for wide tables to horizontally scroll at smaller screen sizes.&#xA;Evidence Problem Relevant theory Solution CEO Office location on top floor &#39;mythical figure&#39; Focussed on results HealthCo is &#39;his baby&#39; CEO leadership style &#39;autocratic&#39; Weber (Bureaucratic management)</description>

      <description>Top navigation As a component, top navigation will require a more customisation according to the context of the site. Options are available for fixing the navigation to the top of screen, hamburger menus and more.&#xA;Simple The optional site name provides a link to the home page. At small screen sizes (width &amp;lt; 768px), this type is scaled to fit the available space. That being said, site titles should remain relatively short.</description>

      <description>Typography Type use default bootstrap scaling (1rem = 16px). On smaller screens, sizes downscale based on desktop sizes: mobile h1 takes desktop h2 values, mobile lead takes desktop lead. Intermediate heading sizes are scaled as per desktop.&#xA;Headings All headings are set in Museo 700, RMIT Blue (#000054) as per brand guidelines. This thicker weight provides good contrast with body text, making the difference between headings and body content very clear.</description>
